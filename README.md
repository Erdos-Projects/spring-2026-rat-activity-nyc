## Description

The New York City (NYC) rat is considered a cultural symbol of NYC. It is estimated that there are about 3 million rats in NYC and in recent history, the number of rats has become ['incredibly problematic'](#https://phys.org/news/2025-08-york-declares-total-war-prolific.html). Rats spread disease, attack small infants and children, spread waste, eat and steal food, and can cause infrstructure damage. However, there is ['some hope'](#https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/nyregion/rats-nyc-snow-cold.html) as the extended winters due to climate change has lead to predictions that the extreme cold would cull the rat population. Furthermore, the widespread adoption of better trash storage systems and better waste management procedures has lead to, allegedly, fewer rat problems. With recent ['breakthroughs in tracking rat movement in NYC'](#https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/is-the-rat-war-over), there is a bit more hope in controlling NYC's rat population.

In this project, we would like to understand the rat population and its movements in NYC. We seek to answer two key questions regarding the rat activity in NYC.

* Can one predict the future number of rat sightings in a given location by using the features: time, past data on rat sightings, past data on rat inspections, proximity to key landmarks such as restaurants, income status in the area, and the type of building we are considering?

* Using the rat sightings data and some of the features considered above, can we predict the likelihood that a the result of a rat inspection is a "Fail"?
